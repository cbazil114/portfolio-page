                <p>
                    Hello, amd welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Connor Bazil, and I am currently a student at the UNH Coding Bootcamp. 
                    <br><br>
                    My education began with a Bachelor's Degree in English, also at UNH where I graduated in 2016. From there, I pursued an interest in film, and finally obtained a Master's Degree in Writing for FIlm and Television from Emerson College. After a couple of years working in content devleopment for a production company, I found that I did not have the same passion I once had before, and have decided to explore another interest of mine - computer science!
